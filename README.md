## Company Bankruptcy Prediction

### Objective
To predict if a company will face bankruptcy using neural networks

### Introduction
Prediction of bankruptcy is a phenomenon of increasing interest to firms who stand to loose money because of unpaid debts. Since computers can store huge dataset
pertaining to bankruptcy, making accurate predictions from them before hand is becoming important. We can use multiple machine learning algorithms like SVM, logistic regression, neural networks, Guassian Naive Bayes, gradient boosting trees etc. to find if a company will undergo bankruptcy based on the historical financial data available for the company.

### Methods
Six methods have been used. 
1. Guassian Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Extreme Gradient Boosting
6. Balanced Bagging

### Libraries Used/Toolkit
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. scipy
4. sklearn
5. xgboost

### Conclusions
I have obtained the accuracy score of the 6 models. Mean accuracies across all models was obtained. We have found that balanced bagging outperforms all other models.
